## **_How TAJJ Mu'Hall works_**

<img src=img2/Tajj_02.png alt="man playingcrowd at concert" width="250" />

#### A user either logs in or creates a new account.<br><br>

#### Upon verification, the user is then directed to a list of concerts and music events happening within their city. <br><br>

#### The user is given a few options to choose from in accordance to the **_artist_**, **_band_**, or **_festival_** they are interested in. Once decided, the user is directed towards a ticket purchase page, and is also able to find other people in their area who are attending the same event.<br><br>

#### The user can then plan a meet and greet, update their profile, as well as supply a review/comment in regards to the concert or event.<br><br>
