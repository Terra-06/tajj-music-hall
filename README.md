## **_How TAJJ Mu'Hall works_**

#### A user logs in and creates an account. Upon verification, user is then directed to a list of concerts and music events happening within their city. The user is given a few options to choose from in accordance to the Artist or Band they are interested in. Once decided, the user is directed towards a ticket purchase page, and is also able to find other people in their area who are also attending the same event, and the user can then plan a meet and greet, as well as supply a review/comment in regards to the concert.
